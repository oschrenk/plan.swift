# Date Parsing


## Resources

- [Apple, NSDataDetector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatadetector) doesn't feel "swifty" enough and covers more than just dates
- [Apple, RelativeDateTimeFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/relativedatetimeformatter)  only handles relative terms
- [Apple, date(withNaturalLanguageString:locale)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate/1407720-date) What I want but deprecated
- [SoulverCore, NLP](https://github.com/soulverteam/SoulverDateFromString) is a Framework and needs a full blown app to be embedded with or needs to be dynamically linked
- [SwiftDate](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate) Doesn't support natural language expressions
