# Obsidian

To better support Obsidian based markdown, it might valid to create template helpers to allow for valid creation of tags.

## Tags

You can use any of the following characters in your tags:

- Alphabetical letters
- Numbers
- Underscore (_)
- Hyphen (-)
- Forward slash (/) for Nested tags

Tags must contain at least one non-numerical character. For example, #1984 isn't a valid tag, but #y1984 is.

Tags are case-insensitive. For example, #tag and #TAG willbe treated as identical.
