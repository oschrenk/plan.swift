# README

A macOS tool to fetch (the next) calendar events as json

## Features

- returns JSON by default
- separates leading emojis from event title, and gives you the emoji, short and full title
- rejects events based on tags `tag:example` within the event notes
- start and end time in relative and absolute terms

## Usage

Example commands (use `plan --help` for full usage)

- `plan today` Returns all events for today
- `plan next` Returns the current or next event within the next hour
- `plan next --reject-tag somekeyword` Returns the current or next event within the next hour ignoring events which notes have text containing `tag:somekeyword`
- `plan calendars` List available calendars

Example output

```json
[
  {
    "id": "UUID:UUID",
    "calendar": {
      "id": "UUID",
      "label": "Some calendar"
    },
    "label": "üèÜ Release plan",
    "legend": {
      "description": "Release plan",
      "icon": "üèÜ",
    },
    "starts_at": "2024-08-09T18:00:00+02:00",
